# My personal blog

I use just pure html, css and js to make the website, it is intended to be just a place where I can at the same time test webdev things and writte about some computer related things I've been doing/studying. The way I built the system to work is simple, I've created a python script using the [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) to convert the markdown files to html pages with some pre-established css classes for certain elements, and to also concatenate the header and footer html files that I've written "by hand".

By the way, if you're interested you can find all the markdown files in the 'MdFiles/content' directory...
