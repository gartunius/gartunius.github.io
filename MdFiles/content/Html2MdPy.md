# So what's Html2MdPy ?

Well it's my way of making a website without having to write the posts directly on html. (And without using any overcomplicated(for my use case at least) tool) (￣ー￣)ｂ

# How does't work ?

That's a good question, idk too, because 'Html2MdPy' it's just a tool that uses the [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) tool to actually render the code, so I think I could call it a 'wrapper', no?

## How do you use it ?

Like pretty much any other CLI tool, with a terminal and passing some parameters, or just use the shell script I made to also do this for you, maybe I could have mad
