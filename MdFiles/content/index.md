# My place with "kinda random" stuff about computers

So after my failed attempt to write a post about assembly ( I didn't wanna do a bad post, and I felt that for a good one, there would be a lot of new things to learn, and I'm not that interested now, so I'll just push that to whenever I fell like :P ), I also decided to make writteups on some CTFs/Wargames that I've played...So this is what this blog is about...at least for now...hope you like it :P

# About Me

I'm just a computer science student, who wants a place to share/"teach"(I've heard that explaining stuff helps with learning) the things I learn both in class, and on the Internet.
